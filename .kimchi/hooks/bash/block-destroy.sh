# Hook: block-destroy.sh (PreToolUse on Bash)
# Purpose: Prevents 'terraform destroy' from running. This is a HARD BLOCK.
# Why: Destroy is irreversible. In a shared AWS account, accidental destroy
#      can delete VPCs, EKS clusters, RDS databases — causing hours of downtime.
# How: Reads the tool input JSON from stdin, extracts the command, checks for
#      'terraform destroy' or 'terragrunt destroy'. Exits 2 to deny execution.
